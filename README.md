Punch for Todo.txt

DESC
====
This is a project forked from http://code.google.com/p/punch-time-tracking/, which was also in-turn forked from https://github.com/adewinter/punch:


 " Punch is a time-tracking add-on for todo.txt - a command line to-do list list utility. Punch works alongside the todo.txt script files popularized by Life Hacker and todotxt.org. All time tracking info is kept in a separate file, so no harm is done to the todo.txt system. It does use your todo.cfg file and todo.txt file to streamline time tracking. "
